    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-learn package allows us to use machine learning packages such as Linear Regression. The only problem is that we can’t use linear regression on a categorical dependent variable. Instead, in such situations, we should try using algorithms such as Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 for success or 0 for failure. In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Logistic Regression >](https://kidquant.com/post/images/logistic_regression.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is one of the most popular ways to fit models for categorical data, especially for binary response data in Data Modeling. It is the most important (and probably the most used) member of a class of models called generalized linear models. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression can directly predict probabilities (values that are restricted to the (0,1) interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable (target) is categorical. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To predict whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0)\n",
    "* Whether a company is a bankrupt (1) or not bankrupt (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is generally used where the dependent variable is Binary or Dichotomous. That means the dependent variable can take only two possible values, such as “Yes” or “No,” “Default” or “No Default,” “Living” or “Dead,” etc. Independent factors or variables can be categorical or numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, logistic regression attempts to predict an outcome (a win or loss) given a set of data points (stats) that likely influence that outcome. The way this works in practice is you feed the algorithm one game at a time, with both the aforementioned “set of data” and the actual outcome of the match. The model then learns how each piece of data you feed it influences the result of the game positively, negatively, and to what extent."
