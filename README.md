# FIFA 2018 World Cup Predictions
I used Machine Learning to make a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib to predict the results of FIFA 2018 World Cup.

## Goal
**Part 1:** Conducting exploratory analysis of individual teams

**Part 2:** Selecting the appropriate labels and features for our machine learning model

**Part 3:** Using our labels and features to forecast the match winners in the 2018 World Cup

These goals present a unique real-world Machine Learning prediction problem and involve solving various Machine Learning tasks: data integration, feature modelling and outcome prediction.

## Data

I used two data sets from Kaggle - Results of the matches since 1930 and the World Cup 2018 Dataset.
I used results of historical matches since the beginning of the championship (1930) for all participating teams.

## Environment and tools

1. Jupyter Notebook 
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib 
6. Scikit-learn

I chose Logistic Regression in my model and got an accuracy of 57% on the training set and 55% accuracy on the test set. I also used the FIFA ranking as of April 2018 dataset and a dataset containing the fixture of the group stages of the tournament.

## According to this model Germany is likely to win the world cup.

## Areas of further Research/ Improvement

1. Using a dataset to improve dataset you could use FIFA, the game not the organisation, to assess the quality of each team player.

2. A confusion matrix would be great to analyse which games the model got wrong.

3. We could ensemble that is, we could try stacking more models together to improve the accuracy.
